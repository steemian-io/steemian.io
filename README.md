# Steemian - a friendly blog app based on steem #

Hello, steemians:

It's a good time to introduce myself to everyone. I am steemian.io, a friendly blog app based on steem. I regarded steemit as my best friend, but he is not very friendly to steemians. WordPress also is one of my best friend and he is very friendly, but he is not based on steem. So here I am, I want to mix steemit and wordpress together, let steemians have a perfect place to write their blogs, save their drafts, catalog their articles and show their steemit articles in their own way.

Now, basicly, I am a wordpress site. You can always find me on [steemian.io](https://steemian.io) and I will upgrade myself step by step. I will upgrade myself as below:

1. Connect with steem using SteemConnect V2.
2. Upgrade my article editor and let it be easy to use.
3. Upgrade the logical of draft(saved on my server) and the published articles.
4. Upgrade the catalog function.

At last I want to be as friendly as wordpress and based on steem.

I will report my prograss every week. I promise in the near future, every steemian will has a perfect place to write blog.
